bash clean_all.sh # <- this should should clean up the metadata and make it usable

python3 rotate_videos.py <- this should make it so I can orient the videos easily

bash go.sh # <- this should embed the metadata into the videos

bash together.sh # <- this should concatenate all the videos together, in order
